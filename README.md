## setup-template-cython

`setuptools`-based `setup.py` template for Cython projects, plus notes on packaging.

### TL;DR

Copy `setup.py`, customize, enjoy.

### Introduction

Setuptools[[1]][setuptools] has become the tool of choice[[2]][packaging] for packaging Python projects, yet not much documentation is available on how to use `setuptools` in Cython projects. As of this writing (Cython 0.25), Cython's [official packaging instructions](http://cython.readthedocs.io/en/latest/src/reference/compilation.html#distributing-cython-modules) are based on `distutils`.

For packages to be distributed (especially through [PyPI](https://pypi.python.org/pypi)), `setuptools` is preferable, since the documentation on distributing packages[[3]][distributing] assumes that is what the developer uses. Also, [`setuptools` adds dependency resolution](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/25337706/setuptools-vs-distutils-why-is-distutils-still-a-thing) (over `distutils`), which is an essential feature of `pip`.

This very minimal project documents the author's best guess at current best practices for the packaging and distribution of Cython projects, by piecing together information from various sources. **Possible corrections, if any, are welcome.**


#### General notes

A (very short) terminology can be found in the [Python documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/distributing/index.html) on distributing Python modules. Probably the best practical documentation on actually distributing your own Python projects, though, is the [packaging guide](https://packaging.python.org/distributing/).

There is a [timeline](https://www.pypa.io/en/latest/history/) of the history of Python packaging (as of August 2017, up to 2015) on the PyPA website.

[This blog post](http://lucumr.pocoo.org/2012/6/22/hate-hate-hate-everywhere/), dated 2012 (before the introduction of the wheel format), explains many interesting technical details, such as the differences between `distutils`, `setuptools` and early `pip`, the install directory structure used by `setuptools`, `.pth` files, and the two kinds of `.egg`s, namely directories and zipfiles.

If you are familiar with `distutils`, but new to `setuptools`, see [the list of new and changed keywords](https://setuptools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/setuptools.html#new-and-changed-setup-keywords) in the `setuptools` documentation.


### Content and aim

The included  [`setup.py`](setup.py) is a `setuptools`-based packaging and install script template for new Cython projects.

This is similar to [simple-cython-example](https://github.com/thearn/simple-cython-example), but our focus is on numerical scientific projects, where a custom Cython extension (containing all-new code) can bring a large speedup. The aim is to help open-sourcing such extensions in a manner that lets others effortlessly compile them, thus advancing the openness and repeatability of science.

For completeness, a minimal Cython-based example library is included, containing examples of things such as absolute cimports, subpackages, [NumPyDoc](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/blob/master/doc/HOWTO_DOCUMENT.rst.txt) style docstrings, and using [memoryviews](http://cython.readthedocs.io/en/latest/src/userguide/memoryviews.html) for passing arrays (for the last two, see [compute.pyx](mylibrary/compute.pyx)). The example in the [test/](test/) subdirectory demonstrates usage of the example library after it is installed.

A pruned-down version of setup.py for pure Python projects, called [`setup-purepython.py`](setup.py), is also provided for comparison.


#### Features

Our [`setup.py`](setup.py) features the following:

 - The most important fields of `setup()`
   - If this is all you need, [simple-cython-example](https://github.com/thearn/simple-cython-example) is much cleaner.
   - If this is all you need, and you somehow ended up here even though your project is pure Python, [PyPA's sampleproject](https://github.com/pypa/sampleproject/blob/master/setup.py) (as mentioned in [[4]][setup-py]) has more detail on this.
 - How to get `absolute_import` working in a Cython project
   - For compatibility with both Python 3 and Python 2.7 (with `from __future__ import absolute_import`)
   - For scientific developers used to Python 2.7, this is perhaps the only tricky part in getting custom Cython code to play nicely with Python 3. (As noted elsewhere[[a]](http://www.python3statement.org/)[[b]](http://python-3-for-scientists.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), it is time to move to Python 3.)
 - How to automatically grab `__version__` from `mylibrary/__init__.py` (using AST; no import or regexes), so that you [DontRepeatYourself](http://wiki.c2.com/?DontRepeatYourself) declaring your package version (based on [[5]][getversion])
 - Hopefully appropriate compiler and linker flags for math and non-math modules on `x86_64`, in production and debug configurations.
   - Also compiler and linker flags for OpenMP, to support `cython.parallel.prange`.
 - How to make `setup.py` pick up non-package data files, such as your documentation and usage examples (based on [[6]][datafolder]). However, see the section on **Packaging data files** below.
 - How to make `setup.py` pick up data files inside your Python packages.
 - How to enforce that `setup.py` is running under a given minimum Python version ([considered harmful](http://stackoverflow.com/a/1093331), but if duck-checking for individual features is not an option for a reason or another) (based on [[7]][enforcing]).
 - Disabling `zip_safe`. Having `zip_safe` enabled (which will in practice happen by default) is a bad idea for Cython projects, because:
   - Cython (as of this writing, version 0.25) will not see `.pxd` headers inside installed `.egg` zipfiles. Thus other libraries cannot `cimport` modules from yours if it has `zip_safe` set.
   - At (Python-level) `import` time, the OS's dynamic library loader usually needs to have the `.so` unzipped (from the `.egg` zipfile) to a temporary directory anyway.


### Usage

See the [`setuptools` manual](http://setuptools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/setuptools.html#command-reference). Perhaps the most useful commands are:

```bash
python setup.py build_ext  # compile binary (Cython) extensions
python setup.py build      # copy .py files in the Python packages into the build directory
python setup.py install    # will automatically "build" and "bdist" first
python setup.py sdist      # create source distribution
```

Substitute `python2` or `python3` for `python` if needed.

For `build_ext`, the switch `--inplace` may be useful for one-file throwaway projects, but packages to be installed are generally much better off by letting `setuptools` create a `build/` subdirectory.

For `install`, the switch `--user` may be useful. As can, alternatively, running the command through `sudo`, depending on your installation.


#### Uninstalling your installed package

Sometimes it is useful to uninstall the installed copy of your package, such as during the development and testing of the install step for a new version.

Whereas `setuptools` does not know how to uninstall packages, `pip` does. This applies also to `setuptools`-based packages not installed by `pip` itself.

(In contrast, legacy `distutils`-based packages contain no metadata and cannot be automatically uninstalled.)

As an example, to uninstall this template project (if you have installed it):

```bash
pip uninstall setup-template-cython
```

The package name is the `name` argument provided to `setup()` in `setup.py`.

Note that, when you invoke the command, if the current working directory of your terminal has a subdirectory with the same name as the package to be uninstalled (here `setup-template-cython`), its presence will mask the package, which is probably not what you want.

If you have installed several versions of the package manually, the above command will uninstall only the most recent version. In this case, invoke the command several times until it reports that `setup-template-cython` is not installed.

Note that `pip` will automatically check also the user directory of the current user (packages installed with `python setup.py install --user`) for the package to uninstall; there is no need to specify any options for that.

Substitute `pip2` or `pip3` for `pip` as needed; run through `sudo` if needed.

To check whether your default `pip` manages your Python 2 or Python 3 packages, use `pip --version`.


#### Distributing binaries

Windows and Mac OS users may be interested in `python setup.py bdist_wheel` to create platform wheels (platform-specific binary distributions).

As for Linux, as noted in the [Python packaging guide](https://packaging.python.org/distributing/#platform-wheels), PyPI accepts platform wheels for Linux only if they conform to [the `manylinux1` ABI](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0513/), so in this case running `python setup.py bdist_wheel` on an arbitrary development machine is generally not very useful for the purposes of distribution.

For the adventurous, PyPA provides [instructions](https://github.com/pypa/manylinux) along with a Docker image.

For the less adventurous, just make an sdist and upload that; scientific Linux users are likely not scared by an automatic compilation step, and will have the development tools already installed anyway.


### Packaging your data files

This is rather intricate. From the viewpoint of Python packaging, data files in your project come in two varieties:

 - **Non-package data files** are files in the project that are to be distributed, but do not belong to any Python package. Typically, this means `README.md` et al., end-user documentation, and usage examples.
 - **Package data** are data files inside Python packages. Typically, this means data files needed by your library (to be loaded at runtime via the [`pkg_resources` API](http://setuptools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/pkg_resources.html), TL;DR [[1]](https://stackoverflow.com/a/20885799) [[2]](https://stackoverflow.com/a/23550979)), or developer documentation specific to a particular package that you want to install into the same location as the package itself.

Non-package data files arguably have no natural install location, unless they are specified with an absolute target path. Thus it is almost always better to package them only into the source distribution (sdist).

On what gets included into the sdist by default, refer to [the documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/distutils/sourcedist.html#specifying-the-files-to-distribute). **GitHub users** specifically note that `README.txt` gets included, but `README.md` does not.

#### Mechanisms

There are three main mechanisms to make `setuptools` pick up data files: `data_files`, `package_data`, and the manifest template `MANIFEST.in`.

The `data_files` option of `setup()` is meant for non-package data files. However, any `data_files` specified with a relative path [will install directly under `sys.prefix`](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24727709/i-dont-understand-python-manifest-in#comment46482024_24727824). **Importantly**, Python environments in different operating systems may behave differently.

For example, on Linux Mint, when `setuptools` installs packages, each `.egg` directory effectively (if not strictly speaking) becomes the prefix for that particular package (as far as the install procedure is concerned).

However, on Mac OS, `setuptools` will use the system prefix, typically `/usr/local`. If `setup.py` specifies (for example) `test/*` to be included as `data_files`, then these files will try to install into `/usr/local/test/*`, which will fail (for good reason).

Thus, although [`setup.py`](setup.py) provides an example of this, using `data_files` is usually not recommended.

For a long time, the `package_data` option of `setup()` was used only for binary distributions and installation, and was ignored for the sdist [[1]](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7522250/how-to-include-package-data-with-setuptools-distribute) [[2]](http://blog.codekills.net/2011/07/15/lies,-more-lies-and-python-packaging-documentation-on--package_data-/). The manifest template `MANIFEST.in` was the way to customize the sdist.

However, both of these features have since been partially extended to cover some tasks of the other, perhaps in an attempt to simplify packaging in simple cases.

The documentation says that [in Python 3.1+](https://docs.python.org/3/distutils/setupscript.html#installing-package-data) (and [also in 2.7](https://docs.python.org/2/distutils/setupscript.html#installing-package-data)), all files specified as `package_data` will be included also into the sdist, **but only if no manifest template is provided**.

The manifest template `MANIFEST.in` is an optional, separate configuration file for `setuptools`, to be placed in the same directory as `setup.py`. It can be used to include additional files (both package and non-package data) into the sdist, and to exclude any undesired files [that would be included in the sdist by default](https://docs.python.org/3/distutils/sourcedist.html#specifying-the-files-to-distribute).

Nowadays, files listed in `MANIFEST.in` [can also be included](http://blog.cykerway.com/posts/2016/10/14/install-package-data-with-setuptools.html) in binary distributions and installation, by setting `include_package_data=True` in the call to `setup()`. The option has no effect on the contents of the sdist. Also, as the name suggests, it only affects files that reside inside Python packages; any non-package data files included by `MANIFEST.in` will still be packaged only into the sdist.


#### Format of `MANIFEST.in`

For an overview, see this [quick explanation](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24727709/i-dont-understand-python-manifest-in). For available commands, see the (very short) [documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/distutils/commandref.html#sdist-cmd).

Simple example `MANIFEST.in`:

```
include *.md
include doc/*.txt
exclude test/testing_scratchpad.py
```

In this example, the argument on each line is a shellglob. Relative paths start from the directory where `setup.py` and `MANIFEST.in` are located.


#### Summary

**`data_files`**:

 - Meant for non-package data files.
 - Not recommended. Relative paths for install targets (output) may cause installation to fail, depending on the configuration of the user's Python environment.
 - May have some limited use, if an absolute target path for installation is applicable. However, note that some developers frown upon (ab)using `pip` for appinit (see last part [here](https://stackoverflow.com/a/23550979)).
 - Relative paths for files to include (input) are specified as relative to the directory `setup.py` resides in.

**`package_data`**:

 - Package data only.
 - Historically, main way to control binary distributions and installation.
 - Now `package_data` is also included into sdist, **if you don't provide** a `MANIFEST.in`.
 - Paths to the data files are specified as relative to each package in question. See the example in [`setup.py`](setup.py).

**`MANIFEST.in`**:

 - Both package data and non-package data files.
 - Historically, main way to control sdist.
 - Now also controls binary distributions and installation (of any *package data* included by it), **if you set** `include_package_data=True` in your call to `setup()`. On the sdist, the option has no effect.
 - Optional. If not provided, the sdist will include certain files [by default](https://docs.python.org/3/distutils/sourcedist.html#specifying-the-files-to-distribute).
 - If this file exists, `package_data` will be ignored for sdist; only `MANIFEST.in` will be used to create the sdist.
 - Paths are specified as relative to the directory `setup.py` and `MANIFEST.in` reside in.

**`package_data` + `MANIFEST.in`**:

 - For creating source and binary distributions completely independently of each other. Be careful.
 - Files specified as `package_data` are included into binary distributions and installation.
 - Files included by `MANIFEST.in` are included into the sdist.
 - The `setup()` option `include_package_data` **must not** be set.


### Implementation notes

 0. This project assumes the end user will have Cython installed, which is likely the case for people writing and interacting with numerics code in Python. Indeed, our [`setup.py`](setup.py) has Cython set as a requirement, and hence the eventual `pip install mylibrary` will pull in Cython if it is not installed.  

    The Cython extensions are always compiled using Cython. Or in other words, regular-end-user-friendly logic for conditionally compiling only the Cython-generated C source, or the original Cython source, has **not** been included. If this is needed, see [this StackOverflow discussion](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4505747/how-should-i-[5]-a-python-package-that-contains-cython-code) for hints. See also item 2 below.  

    The generated C source files, however, are included in the resulting distribution (both sdist and bdist).

 1. In Cython projects, it is preferable to always use absolute module paths when `absolute_import` is in use, even if the module to be cimported is located in the same directory (as the module that is doing the cimport). This allows using the same module paths for imports and cimports.  
 
    The reason for this recommendation is that the relative variant (`from . cimport foo`), although in line with [PEP 328](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0328/), is difficult to get to work properly with Cython's include path.  

    Our [`setup.py`](setup.py) adds `.`, the top-level directory containing `setup.py`, to Cython's include path, but does not add any of its subdirectories. This makes the cimports with absolute module paths work correctly[[8]][packagehierarchy] (also when pointing to the library being compiled), assuming `mylibrary` lives in a `mylibrary/` subdirectory of the top-level directory that contains `setup.py`. See the included example.

 2. Historically, it was common practice in `setup.py` to import Cython's replacement for `distutils`' `build_ext`, in order to make `setup()` recognize `.pyx` source files.  

    Instead, we let `setuptools` keep its `build_ext`, and call `cythonize()` explicitly in the invocation of `setup()`. As of this writing, this is the approach given in [Cython's documentation](http://cython.readthedocs.io/en/latest/src/reference/compilation.html#compiling-with-distutils), albeit it refers to `distutils` instead of `setuptools`.  

    This gives us some additional bonuses:
      - Cython extensions can be compiled in debug mode (for use with [cygdb](http://cython.readthedocs.io/en/latest/src/userguide/debugging.html)).
      - We get `make`-like dependency resolution; a `.pyx` source file is automatically re-cythonized, if a `.pxd` file it cimports, changes.
      - We get the nice `[1/4] Cythonizing mylibrary/main.pyx` progress messages when `setup.py` runs, whenever Cython detects it needs to compile `.pyx` sources to C.
      - By requiring Cython, there is no need to store the generated C source files in version control; they are not meant to be directly human-editable.

    The `setuptools` documentation gives advice that, depending on interpretation, [may be in conflict with this](https://setuptools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/setuptools.html#distributing-extensions-compiled-with-pyrex) (considering Cython is based on Pyrex). We do not import Cython's replacement for `build_ext`, but following the Cython documentation, we do import `cythonize` and call it explicitly.  

    Because we do this, `setuptools` sees only C sources, so we miss `setuptools`' [automatic switching](https://setuptools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/setuptools.html#distributing-extensions-compiled-with-pyrex) of Cython and C compilation depending on whether Cython is installed (see the source code for `setuptools.extension.Extension`). Our approach requires having Cython installed even if the generated C sources are up to date (in which case the Cython compilation step will no-op, skipping to the C compilation step).  

    This also has the effect that, since `setuptools` does not see the Cython source files, it will not package them by default; hence the use of `package_data` in [`setup.py`](setup.py) to package both the `.pyx` and `.pxd` files.  

    Note also that `cythonize()` will run even if the command-line options given to `setup.py` are nonsense (or more commonly, contain a typo), since it runs first, before control even passes to `setup()`. Don't go grab your coffee until the build starts compiling the generated C sources.  

    For better or worse, the chosen approach favors Cython's own mechanism for handling `.pyx` sources over the one provided by `setuptools`.

 3. Old versions of Cython may choke on the `cythonize()` options `include_path` and/or `gdb_debug`. If `setup.py` gives mysterious errors that can be traced back to these, try upgrading your Cython installation.  

    Note that `pip install cython --upgrade` gives you the latest version. (You may need to add `--user`, or run it through `sudo`, depending on your installation.)

 4. Using `setuptools` with Cython projects needs `setuptools >= 18.0`, to correctly support Cython in `requires`[[9]][setuptools18].  

    In practice this is not a limitation, as `18.0` is already a very old version (`35.0` being current at the time of this writing). In the unlikely event that it is necessary to support versions of `setuptools` even older than `18.0`, it is possible[[9]][setuptools18] to use [setuptools-cython](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools_cython/) from PyPI. (This package is not needed if `setuptools >= 18.0`.)


### Distributing your package

If you choose to release your package for distribution:

 0. See the [distributing](https://packaging.python.org/distributing/) section of the packaging guide, and especially the subsection on [uploading to PyPI](https://packaging.python.org/distributing/#uploading-your-project-to-pypi).

    Especially if your package has dependencies, it is important to get at least an sdist onto PyPI to make the package easy to install (via `pip install`).  

      - Also, keep in mind that outside managed environments such as Anaconda, `pip` is the preferred way for installing scientific Python packages, even though having multiple package managers on the same system could be considered harmful. Scientific packages are relatively rapidly gaining new features, thus making access to the latest release crucial.  

        (Debian-based Linux distributions avoid conflicts between the two sets of managed files by making `sudo pip install` install to `/usr/local`, while the system `apt-get` installs to `/usr`. This does not, however, prevent breakage caused by overrides (loading a newer version from `/usr/local`), if it happens that some Python package is not fully backward-compatible. A proper solution requires [one of the virtualenv tools](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/41573587/what-is-the-difference-between-venv-pyvenv-pyenv-virtualenv-virtualenvwrappe) at the user end.)  

 1. Be sure to use `twine upload`, **not** ~~`python -m setup upload`~~, since the latter may transmit your password in plaintext.  

    ~~Before the first upload of a new project, use `twine register`.~~ As of August 2017, pre-registration of new packages is no longer needed or supported; just proceed to upload. See [new instructions](https://packaging.python.org/guides/migrating-to-pypi-org/#uploading).  

    [Official instructions for twine](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/twine).

 2. Generally speaking, it is [a good idea to disregard old advice](http://stackoverflow.com/a/14753678) on Python packaging. By 2020 when Python 2.7 support ends, that probably includes this document.  

    For example, keep in mind that `pip` has replaced `ez_setup`, and nowadays `pip` (in practice) comes with Python.  

    Many Python distribution tools have been sidelined by history, or merged back into the supported ones (see [the StackOverflow answer already linked above](http://stackoverflow.com/a/14753678)). Distutils and setuptools remain, nowadays [fulfilling different roles](http://stackoverflow.com/a/40176290).


### Compatibility

Tested on Linux Mint, Python 2.7 and 3.4.

On Mac OS, the `data_files` approach used in the example will not work. See other options for packaging non-package data files above.

Not tested on Windows (please send feedback, e.g. by opening an issue).

#### Platform-specific notes

On **Linux Mint**:

 - The package installs into a subdirectory of the base install location, with a name following the format `setup_template_cython-0.1.4-py3.4-linux-x86_64.egg`. The `mylibrary` and `test` subdirectories appear under that, as does this README.
 - with `python3 setup.py install --user`, the base install location is `$HOME/.local/lib/python3.4/site-packages/`.
 - with `sudo python3 setup.py install`, the base install location is `/usr/local/lib/python3.4/dist-packages/`.

Then, in Python, `import mylibrary` will import the library. The `test` subdirectory of the project is harmless; `import test` will still import Python's own `test` module.
